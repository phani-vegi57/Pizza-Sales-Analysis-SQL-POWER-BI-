 *******Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL Server and Power BI)*******

*******Project Description:*******

This project involves the analysis of pizza sales data from January 2015 to December 2015. The analysis is performed using SQL Server for data querying and Power BI for visualization. The main objectives of the analysis include deriving insights such as total orders, total revenue, and average sales. The project also offers detailed information about the top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas based on categories, sizes, and revenue.

*******Prerequisites:*******
- Power BI Desktop July 2023 version
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (v 19.1.56.0)
- Familiarity with Power Query for data cleansing and transformation

*******Data:*******

The analysis is conducted on a single dataset called "pizza sales." This dataset contains various fields including pizza name, order ID, pizza category, price, revenue, order date, and more.


*******Analysis:*******

The project involves the following steps:
1. Data Cleansing and Transformation: Utilizing Power Query, the dataset is cleansed and transformed to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis.
2. SQL Server Queries: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio is used to execute SQL queries to extract specific values required for the analysis.
3. Visualization: Power BI is employed to create visually appealing and insightful reports. The reports showcase key metrics such as total orders, total revenue, and average sales. Additionally, the reports provide details about the top and bottom 5 pizzas based on category, size, and revenue.

*******Usage:*******

To replicate or explore this analysis, follow these steps:
1. Install Power BI July 2023 version.
2. Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
3. Run SQL queries provided in the project to extract required data.
4. Import the data in SQL Server by connect the server into Power BI  and for cleansing and transformation of data using Power Query Editor.
5. Create Power BI reports to visualize the analysis results.

*******Conclusion:*******

This project demonstrates the integration of SQL Server and Power BI for analysing and visualizing pizza sales data. It highlights the importance of data cleansing, SQL querying, and effective visualization in deriving meaningful insights from raw data.
